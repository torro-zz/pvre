i just tried to run a competitor analysis on an existing search and het this "Research Failed
credit_deduction_failed"

when going nto run the competitor analysis, it takes a few seconds time to actually auto fill the hypothesis. this is not user friendly as they are thinking it's up tp them to fill it in. 

I also can't easily find the admin center to add credits to people and see how they are using the tool. 

I want to also add some analytics for myself to have an idea on the most important signals. Spend, LTV, how much they come back and what frequency, how much the searches cost us and how much tokens they take VS how much they paid for their credit (as credit prices might change over time)
