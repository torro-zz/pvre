# PVRE Implementation Plan

Last updated: December 16, 2025 (App-Centric Analysis added)

Master roadmap for PVRE development. For active bugs, see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

---

## Vision Summary

**Today:** Validation tool for entrepreneurs using Reddit data
**Tomorrow:** Market intelligence platform serving entrepreneurs AND investors using multi-source data

**Key milestones:**
1. Fix current data quality issues (tiering, removed posts)
2. Add UX improvements inspired by Buzzabout competitor analysis
3. Expand to multi-source data (App Stores, YouTube, TikTok)
4. Launch VC-specific features and pricing tier
5. Build two-sided intelligence platform

---

## Phase 1: Data Quality Fixes (Current Sprint)

### 1.1 Signal Tiering System
**Priority:** P0
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Fixes theme misalignment for multi-domain hypotheses

**Problem:** System finds posts matching ANY domain instead of ALL domains. User asks about "gym socialization," gets themes about general social anxiety.

**Solution:** Three-tier classification instead of binary Y/N:
- **CORE** — Intersection match (both context + problem)
- **RELATED** — Single-domain match (context OR problem)
- **N** — No match

**Implementation:**

Modify Problem Gate in `src/lib/research/relevance-filter.ts`:

```
TIERED RELEVANCE CHECK

HYPOTHESIS: {{hypothesis}}

DOMAIN BREAKDOWN:
- PRIMARY CONTEXT: {{primaryDomain}} (e.g., "gym/fitness environment")
- PROBLEM: {{problem}} (e.g., "wanting to socialize but not knowing how")

For each post, determine the RELEVANCE TIER:

CORE (intersection match):
- Post discusses the PROBLEM within the PRIMARY CONTEXT
- Example: "How do I talk to people at the gym?" → CORE

RELATED (single-domain match):
- Post discusses PROBLEM but not in PRIMARY CONTEXT, OR
- Post is about PRIMARY CONTEXT but not the specific PROBLEM
- Example: "I can't keep friends as an adult" → RELATED

N (no match):
- Post doesn't match either domain
- Post explicitly conflicts with hypothesis
- Example: "I hate gyms, workout at home" → N
```

**Theme extraction weighting:**
- Themes derived PRIMARILY from CORE signals
- RELATED signals labeled as "CONTEXTUAL"
- CORE themes appear first in report

**Report display:**
```
Total Signals: 36
├── Core Signals: 8 (directly about gym socialization)
└── Related Signals: 28 (broader context)

[CORE] Anxiety about approaching people at the gym
[CORE] Uncertainty about gym social etiquette
[CONTEXTUAL] General difficulty making adult friendships
```

**Detect when to apply tiering:**
Apply when primaryDomain is a SETTING (gym, workplace, school, home, restaurant) rather than a PROBLEM DOMAIN (validation, loneliness, productivity).

---

### 1.2 Always Include Removed Posts
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** Low
**Impact:** +50-100% more signals

**Problem:** ~50% of Reddit content is [removed]. Currently only recovered when data sparse (<10 posts).

**Solution:** ALWAYS recover posts with substantive titles (>30 chars).

**Implementation:**

Modify quality gate:
```
if (post.body === '[removed]') {
  if (post.title.length >= 30 && !isSpamTitle(post.title)) {
    return { 
      decision: 'Y',
      reason: 'removed_recoverable',
      analysisMode: 'title_and_comments',
      body: `[Content removed by moderator] Title: ${post.title}`
    };
  }
}
```

**Weighting:** 0.7x for removed posts (not 0.5x — titles are often the clearest pain expression)

**Transparency in report:**
```
Content Analyzed: 84 items
├── Full posts: 24
├── Recovered posts: 42 (title + comments only)
└── Comments: 18
```

**Quote attribution:**
```
"How do I approach someone at the gym?"
— r/socialskills [from post title, body removed]
```

---

## Phase 2: UX Improvements (Inspired by Buzzabout)

### 2.1 Conversational Input Redesign
**Priority:** P0
**Effort:** High
**Impact:** Dramatically reduces friction, solves multi-domain problem at input stage

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout uses single text field + AI interpretation instead of structured forms.

**Current PVRE:** 3-4 structured fields (Audience, Problem, Language, Solution)
- Higher friction
- Users confused about which box to use
- Feels like homework

**New approach:** Single input → AI interprets → User confirms

**Implementation:**

**Step 1: Single Input Field**
```

**Step 4: Refinement Suggestions (for vague inputs)**

If AI detects ambiguity or multi-domain hypothesis:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎯 I can search for this, but you might get better      │
│    results with a more specific angle:                   │

│ Your search: "gym socializing"                           │
│                                                          │
│ Suggested refinements:                                   │
│                                                          │
│ 👥 By audience:                                          │
│    • "introverts wanting gym friends"                   │
│    • "women who want to meet people at the gym"         │
│    • "older adults socializing through fitness"         │
│                                                          │
│ 🎯 By specific pain:                                     │
│    • "fear of being seen as creepy at the gym"          │
│    • "headphone culture making gym conversation hard"   │
│    • "not knowing gym social etiquette"                 │
│                                                          │
│ [Search as-is]  [Use a suggestion]  [Write my own]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Backend changes:**

New API endpoint: `/api/research/interpret-hypothesis`
```typescript
// Input
{ rawInput: "gym socializing" }

// Output
{
  interpretation: {
    audience: "People who go to gyms",
    problem: "Want to socialize but don't know how",
    searchPhrases: ["How do I talk to people at the gym", ...],
    confidence: "medium",
    ambiguities: ["Could mean gym-goers OR fitness instructors"]
  },
  refinementSuggestions: [
    { type: "audience", suggestion: "introverts at the gym" },
    { type: "pain", suggestion: "fear of being creepy" }
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- One field = dramatically lower friction
- AI does the hard work of structuring
- User confirms understanding BEFORE spending credits
- Catches multi-domain issues early with refinement suggestions
- Structured form still available for power users

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout has checkboxes for Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, X, LinkedIn.

**Implementation:**
```
Sources:
☑ Reddit          ☑ TikTok         ☑ Hacker News
☐ Instagram       ☐ YouTube        ☐ Indie Hackers

Date range: Last 3 months ▼
Language: English ▼
```

**Note:** Only show sources we actually support. Add more as we build adapters.

---

### 2.5 "Ask Anything" Chat on Results
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** High
**Impact:** High engagement, differentiation

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout has "Ask anything..." input on results page.

**Implementation:**

After showing report, add chat interface:
```
Ask about your results...

Suggested questions:
• "What's the most common complaint?"
• "Which subreddits had strongest signals?"
• "What price points are mentioned?"
• "Show me the most emotional posts"
```

**Technical approach:**
- Store raw signals in job record
- Chat queries the stored data with Claude
- Answers reference specific quotes/sources

---

### 2.6 Better Loading Experience
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** Low
**Impact:** Delight, professionalism

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout has playful step names + quotes.

**Current steps:** Generic "Processing..."

**New steps:**
1. Firing up the engines
2. Gathering the juicy data
3. Picking out the hot takes
4. Connecting the dots
5. Calculating the numbers
6. Packaging your insights

**Add rotating quotes:**
- "What you show is more important than what you say." — David Ogilvy
- "Fall in love with the problem, not the solution." — Uri Levine
- "Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning." — Bill Gates

---

### 2.7 Subscription Pricing Option
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Power user retention, predictable revenue

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout offers both one-time AND monthly.

**Current:** One-time packs only (£14/£39/£79)

**Add monthly tiers:**
| Tier | Price | Researches | Per Research |
|------|-------|------------|--------------|
| Starter | £29/mo | 5 | £5.80 |

**Benefits:**
- Predictable revenue
- Power users stay subscribed
- Higher LTV than one-time purchases

---

### 2.8 Emotions Breakdown (Beyond Positive/Negative)
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Richer sentiment analysis

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout shows 6 emotions, not just positive/negative.

**Implementation:**

Instead of just sentiment score, break down by emotion:
```
Emotions in Community Discussions:

😊 Joy         ████████████████░░░░  43.4%
😐 Neutral     ██████████░░░░░░░░░░  28.1%
😢 Sadness     █████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  12.0%
😠 Anger       ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   5.7%
😮 Surprise    ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   4.9%
😨 Fear        █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   4.0%
```

**Prompt addition for theme extraction:**
```
For each signal, also classify the PRIMARY EMOTION:
- Joy (excitement, happiness, enthusiasm)
- Neutral (factual, informational)
- Sadness (disappointment, frustration, regret)
- Anger (complaints, outrage, annoyance)
- Surprise (unexpected discovery, amazement)
- Fear (worry, anxiety, concern)
```

**Value:** Tells user HOW people feel, not just what they say. Anger signals = urgent problems. Fear signals = risk concerns.

---

### 2.9 Actionable Executive Summary
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Higher perceived value

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout summaries include strategic recommendations with bolded key terms.

**Current PVRE:** Descriptive summaries ("People discuss X...")

**New format:**
```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Conversation momentum is rising around gym socialization, with 
**social anxiety** and **etiquette uncertainty** as the dominant 
pain drivers. The most resonant content involves **approaching 
strangers** and **headphone culture** complaints.

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Position around "low-pressure" social features (matches pain)
2. Address etiquette confusion with clear guidelines
3. Target the "introverted gym-goer" segment (highest pain intensity)

KEY OPPORTUNITY: "Gym buddy matching" mentioned 54 times with 
high emotional intensity — strong product signal.
```

**Prompt enhancement:**
```
End with 2-3 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS based on the data.
Format: Action verb + specific tactic + why (based on evidence)
Bold the key terms that would be important for positioning.
```

---

### 2.10 Topic Resonance Scoring
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** Low
**Impact:** Better signal prioritization

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout shows "Resonance" (Low/Medium/High) per topic.

**Definition:** Resonance = Engagement relative to views
- High views, low engagement = Low resonance (people see but don't care)
- Lower views, high engagement = High resonance (people really care)

**Implementation:**
```
resonanceScore = (likes + comments * 2) / views * 1000

Thresholds:
- High: resonanceScore > 50
- Medium: resonanceScore 20-50
- Low: resonanceScore < 20
```

**Display in themes:**
```
[HIGH RESONANCE] Anxiety about approaching people at the gym
People engage strongly with this topic — 8.2% engagement rate

[LOW RESONANCE] General fitness advice
High volume but low engagement — people aren't as invested
```

---

### 2.11 Activity Timeline with Spike Detection
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** High
**Impact:** Trend intelligence

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout shows activity over time with annotated spikes and AI explanations.

**Implementation:**

1. **Chart:** Plot mentions/signals over time (last 3 months)
2. **Spike detection:** Identify when volume > 2x average
3. **AI explanation:** "What caused this spike?"

**Example output:**
```
📈 ACTIVITY TIMELINE

Mentions Spike: September 22-26, 2025

There was a clear spike reaching 10,149 mentions—significantly 
higher than the surrounding 1,186 average.

Likely cause: Viral TikTok about "gym approach anxiety" posted 
Sep 21 by @fitnessgirl (2.3M views) triggered widespread discussion.

Takeaway: This topic has viral potential when framed around 
social anxiety rather than just fitness.
```

---

### 2.12 Pre-Built "Skills" for Chat
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Guided exploration, engagement

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout has clickable skills: Pain points mining, Executive summary, Positive/negative quotes.

**Implementation:**

After showing results, offer quick-action buttons:
```
Chat with your data:

[📊 Pain points mining]     [📝 Executive summary]
[💬 Key quotes]             [🎯 Product opportunities]
[📈 Trend analysis]         [🔍 Competitor mentions]
```

Each button runs a pre-built prompt against the stored signals.

**Example "Pain points mining" prompt:**
```
Analyze these signals and extract the TOP 5 specific pain points.
For each:
1. State the pain in user's language
2. Frequency (how many mentions)
3. Intensity (how emotional)
4. Quote example
5. Product implication
```

---

### 2.13 Topic Monitoring (Subscribe)
**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** High
**Impact:** Retention, ongoing value

**Inspiration:** Buzzabout has 🔔 Subscribe button for ongoing monitoring.

**Implementation:**

User can "subscribe" to a research topic:
- Weekly email digest of new mentions
- Alert when spike detected
- Monthly trend report

**Pricing:** Premium feature for subscribers only (not one-time purchases)

**Technical:** 
- Cron job runs searches weekly
- Compares to baseline
- Sends email via Resend/SendGrid

### 3.1 Unified Data Architecture

**CRITICAL: One Adapter Per Source File**

Each data source MUST have its own dedicated adapter file. This allows us to:
- Fix bugs in one source without affecting others
- Add/remove sources easily
- Test each adapter independently
- Handle rate limits and errors per-source

**File Structure:**
```
src/lib/data-sources/
├── types.ts                      # Unified signal schema (shared)
├── orchestrator.ts               # Source selection + merge logic
│

**Unified Signal Interface (types.ts):**

```typescript
export interface UnifiedSignal {
  id: string;
  source: 'reddit' | 'hacker_news' | 'youtube' | 'google_play' | 'app_store' | 'tiktok';
  source_type: 'discussion' | 'review' | 'video' | 'comment';
  
  // Content
  title: string;
  body: string;
  url: string;
  
  // Metadata
  author: string;
  community: string;        // subreddit, "hackernews", channel name, app name
  created_at: Date;
  
  // Engagement (normalized 0-100)
  engagement_score: number;
  raw_engagement: {         // Original metrics for transparency
    upvotes?: number;
    comments?: number;
    views?: number;
    points?: number;
    rating?: number;        // For reviews: 1-5 stars
  };
}

export interface SearchOptions {
  maxResults?: number;
  dateRange?: { start: Date; end: Date };
  sortBy?: 'relevance' | 'date' | 'engagement';
}

export interface DataSourceAdapter {
  source: string;
  search(query: string, options?: SearchOptions): Promise<UnifiedSignal[]>;
  getComments?(itemId: string): Promise<UnifiedSignal[]>;
  healthCheck(): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

**Example Adapter Implementation:**

```typescript
// adapters/hacker-news-adapter.ts
import { UnifiedSignal, DataSourceAdapter, SearchOptions } from '../types';

const HN_API_BASE = 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1';

export class HackerNewsAdapter implements DataSourceAdapter {
  source = 'hacker_news' as const;
  
  async search(query: string, options?: SearchOptions): Promise<UnifiedSignal[]> {
    try {
      // 1. Fetch from Algolia API
      const response = await fetch(
        `${HN_API_BASE}/search?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&tags=story&hitsPerPage=50`
      );
      const data = await response.json();
      
      // 2. Transform to unified schema
      return data.hits.map(hit => this.transformToSignal(hit));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('[HackerNewsAdapter] Search failed:', error);
      return []; // Return empty, don't throw
    }
  }
  
  async healthCheck(): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
      const res = await fetch(`${HN_API_BASE}/search?query=test&hitsPerPage=1`);
      return res.ok;
    } catch {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  private transformToSignal(hit: any): UnifiedSignal {
    return {
      id: `hn_${hit.objectID}`,
      source: 'hacker_news',
      source_type: 'discussion',
      title: hit.title || '',
      body: hit.story_text || '',
      url: hit.url || `https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=${hit.objectID}`,
      author: hit.author || 'unknown',
      community: 'hackernews',
      created_at: new Date(hit.created_at_i * 1000),
      engagement_score: this.calculateEngagement(hit),
      raw_engagement: {
        points: hit.points,
        comments: hit.num_comments,
      }
    };
  }
  
  private calculateEngagement(hit: any): number {
    // Normalize to 0-100 based on HN typical ranges
    const points = hit.points || 0;
    const comments = hit.num_comments || 0;
    return Math.min(100, (points + comments * 2) / 5);
  }
}
```

**Orchestrator Usage:**

```typescript
// orchestrator.ts
export class DataSourceOrchestrator {
  private adapters: Map<string, DataSourceAdapter>;
  
  constructor() {
    this.adapters = new Map([
      ['reddit', new RedditAdapter()],
      ['hacker_news', new HackerNewsAdapter()],
      ['youtube', new YouTubeAdapter()],
      // ... register all adapters
    ]);
  }
  
  async searchAll(
    query: string, 
    sources: string[], 
    options?: SearchOptions
  ): Promise<UnifiedSignal[]> {
    // Fetch from all sources in parallel
    const results = await Promise.allSettled(
      sources.map(source => {
        const adapter = this.adapters.get(source);
        return adapter?.search(query, options) ?? [];
      })
    );
    
    // Merge successful results
    return results
      .filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled')
      .flatMap(r => (r as PromiseFulfilledResult<UnifiedSignal[]>).value);
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL: Claude Relevance Filtering Step**

After fetching raw signals from adapters, we MUST filter through Claude to determine relevance to the hypothesis. This is where we decide what content to show the user.

```typescript
// filters/relevance-filter.ts
export async function filterSignals(
  signals: UnifiedSignal[],
  hypothesis: string
): Promise<FilteredSignal[]> {
  // Batch signals (e.g., 20 at a time) and send to Claude API
  // Claude determines: CORE / RELATED / N for each signal
  // Claude also extracts pain signals from relevant content
  // Returns only CORE + RELATED signals with extracted insights
}
```

**The flow is:**
1. **Adapters fetch RAW data** from sources (no filtering)
2. **Orchestrator merges** into unified format
3. **Claude filters for RELEVANCE** (is this about the hypothesis?)
4. **Only relevant signals** go to analysis/display

**Architecture Rules:**

✅ **DO:**
- Keep each adapter in its own file
- Always normalize to UnifiedSignal schema
- Handle errors gracefully (return `[]`, don't throw)
- Log adapter-specific errors with `[AdapterName]` prefix
- Implement rate limiting per adapter
- Test each adapter independently
- Cache responses where appropriate

❌ **DO NOT:**
- Mix adapter logic with filtering logic
- Put multiple sources in one file
- Skip the Claude filtering step
- Return source-specific data structures to the rest of the app
- Let one adapter failure crash the whole search

### 3.2 Google Play Store Adapter
**Priority:** P0 — Implement First
**Cost:** FREE
**Best for:** Mobile app validation, competitor analysis, user pain from reviews

**Library:** `google-play-scraper` npm package
```bash
npm install google-play-scraper
```

**Capabilities:**
```typescript
import gplay from 'google-play-scraper';

// Search for competing apps
const apps = await gplay.search({ 
  term: 'water reminder', 
  num: 20,
  country: 'us'
});

// Get app details (installs, rating, price)
const appDetails = await gplay.app({ appId: 'com.example.app' });

// Get user reviews (PAIN SIGNALS!)
const reviews = await gplay.reviews({ 
  appId: 'com.example.app',
  sort: gplay.sort.NEWEST,
  num: 100
});

// Get similar apps (competitive landscape)
const similar = await gplay.similar({ appId: 'com.example.app' });
```

**What we extract for PVRE:**
| Data Point | PVRE Use |
|------------|----------|
| App count for keyword | Competition saturation |
| Average rating | Solution quality in market |
| Install counts | Market size validation |
| Negative reviews (1-2 stars) | Unmet needs / pain signals |
| Feature requests in reviews | Product opportunity gaps |
| Pricing (free/paid/IAP) | Willingness to pay signals |

**Rate limits:** No official limit, but implement throttling (1 req/sec) to avoid blocks.

**Source weighting:** 1.0x for app data, 1.2x for review pain signals

---

### 3.3 Apple App Store Adapter
**Priority:** P0 — Implement with Google Play
**Cost:** FREE
**Best for:** iOS competitor landscape, premium user segment

**Library:** `app-store-scraper` npm package (same interface as Google Play)
```bash
npm install app-store-scraper
```

**Capabilities:**
```typescript
import store from 'app-store-scraper';

// Search apps
const apps = await store.search({ 
  term: 'water reminder', 
  num: 20,
  country: 'us'
});

// Get reviews
const reviews = await store.reviews({ 
  id: '123456789',
  sort: store.sort.RECENT,
  page: 1
});
```

**iOS-specific value:**
- Higher-value users (more likely to pay)
- Different competitive landscape than Android
- Review quality often higher/more detailed

**Source weighting:** 1.1x (slightly higher quality reviews)

---

### 3.4 YouTube Data API Adapter
**Priority:** P1 — Implement Week 3
**Cost:** FREE (10,000 quota units/day)
**Best for:** Tutorial demand, problem frequency, trend validation

**API:** Official YouTube Data API v3 (requires API key)
```typescript
// Search costs 100 units = ~100 searches/day on free tier
const response = await fetch(
  `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?` +
  `part=snippet&q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}` +
  `&type=video&maxResults=25&key=${API_KEY}`
);
```

**What we extract for PVRE:**
| Data Point | PVRE Use |
|------------|----------|
| Video count for "how to X" | Problem frequency |
| View counts | Interest level / demand |
| Publish dates | Trend timing (growing/declining) |
| Comment sentiment | Pain validation |
| "Solution" videos existing | Competition signal |

**Quota management:**
- Search: 100 units (100/day)
- Video details: 1 unit (10,000/day)
- Aggressive caching (24hr TTL for searches)

**Source weighting:** 0.8x (less direct than community discussions)

---

### 3.5 TikTok Adapter
**Priority:** P1 — Implement Week 3
**Cost:** FREE (open-source)
**Best for:** Emerging trends, consumer products, Gen Z audience

**Library:** `davidteather/TikTok-Api` (Python, 7.5k+ stars)
```bash
pip install TikTokApi
python -m playwright install
```

**How it works:**
- Unofficial wrapper using Playwright browser automation
- No commercial use restrictions mentioned
- Actively maintained, handles TikTok's anti-bot measures
- Requires `ms_token` from TikTok cookies
- May need proxies for reliability

**Capabilities:**
```python
from TikTokApi import TikTokApi
import asyncio

async def get_trending():
    async with TikTokApi() as api:
        await api.create_sessions(
            ms_tokens=[ms_token], 
            num_sessions=1,
            browser='chromium'
        )
        # Trending videos
        async for video in api.trending.videos(count=30):
            print(video.as_dict)
        
        # Hashtag search
        tag = api.hashtag(name="homegym")
        async for video in tag.videos(count=30):
            print(video.stats)  # views, likes, comments, shares
        
        # User videos
        user = api.user(username="fitnessgirl")
        async for video in user.videos(count=30):
            print(video.as_dict)
```

**What we extract for PVRE:**
| Data Point | PVRE Use |
|------------|----------|
| Hashtag video counts | Topic popularity |
| Video stats (views, likes, shares) | Engagement / trend momentum |
| Trending videos | What's hot now |
| User content analysis | Creator landscape |
| Video comments | Pain signals from Gen Z |

**Integration notes:**
- Python library → call from Node.js via child process or microservice
- Implement session recovery for reliability
- Cache results aggressively (TikTok may rate limit)
- Consider proxy rotation for production scale

**Unique value:** Shows what's EMERGING 6-18 months before mainstream adoption.

**Source weighting:** 1.3x for trend/timing, 0.7x for pain signals (less detailed than Reddit)

---

### 3.6 Hacker News Adapter
**Priority:** P1 — Implement Week 2
**Cost:** FREE, no auth required
**Best for:** Tech/SaaS validation, developer tools, startup challenges

**API:** Algolia HN Search API (free, unlimited, no auth)

https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=KEYWORDS&tags=ask_hn
```

**Capabilities:**
```typescript
// Search stories
const stories = await fetch(
  `https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=${query}&tags=story&hitsPerPage=50`
).then(r => r.json());

// Search Ask HN posts (direct pain signals!)
const askHN = await fetch(
  `https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=${query}&tags=ask_hn&hitsPerPage=50`
).then(r => r.json());

// Search Show HN (competitor launches)
const showHN = await fetch(
  `https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=${query}&tags=show_hn&hitsPerPage=50`
).then(r => r.json());

// Get comments for a story
const comments = await fetch(
  `https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/${storyId}`
).then(r => r.json());
```

**What we extract for PVRE:**
| Data Point | PVRE Use |
|------------|----------|
| Ask HN posts | Direct pain signals ("How do you handle X?") |
| Show HN posts | Competitor launch tracking |
| Story points | Interest/engagement level |
| Comment discussions | Problem validation, opinions |
| Historical search | Trend over time |

**Why HN is valuable:**
- Same audience as PVRE target users (tech entrepreneurs)
- High-quality discussions, rarely spam
- Ask HN = people explicitly asking for solutions
- Show HN = competitor landscape
- No rate limits, no auth required

**Source weighting:** 1.2x (high quality, highly relevant for tech validation)

---

### 3.7 Source Orchestration

**Auto-select sources based on hypothesis domain:**

```
Hypothesis domain includes:    → Sources to use:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
tech, startup, saas, dev      → Reddit + HN + IH
consumer, lifestyle           → Reddit + TikTok + Instagram
mobile, app                   → Reddit + App Stores
entrepreneur, bootstrap       → Reddit + IH + HN
fitness, health              → Reddit + TikTok + App Stores
```

**Source attribution in reports:**
```
Total Signals: 84
├── Reddit: 36 signals
├── Hacker News: 12 signals
├── Indie Hackers: 8 signals
└── App Store Reviews: 28 signals
```

---

### 3.8 App-Centric Analysis Mode (NEW)
**Priority:** P0 — Next Major Feature
**Effort:** High (2-3 weeks)
**Impact:** New use case, competitor intelligence, serves VCs and PMs

**The Insight:** App store reviews represent fundamentally different data than Reddit/HN discussions:
- **Reddit/HN answers:** "What problems exist? What do people wish existed?"
- **App Store answers:** "How well do existing solutions solve those problems?"

These aren't competing sources—they're complementary stages in the validation journey.

---

#### 3.8.1 Two Research Entry Points

**Entry A: Problem-First (existing)**
```
"People struggle with meditation consistency" 
→ Reddit/HN pain signals 
→ THEN pull Calm, Headspace reviews to see competitor gaps
```

**Entry B: App-First (new)**
```
User pastes: https://apps.apple.com/app/calm/id571800810
→ Extract app metadata + reviews
→ AI interprets problem domain
→ Auto-generate Reddit/HN searches
→ Gap analysis + pain synthesis
```

Same analytical engine, different starting inputs. Both arrive at actionable intelligence.

---

#### 3.8.2 URL Detection & Routing

**Decision:** Extend existing `interpret-hypothesis` endpoint with URL detection (not a new endpoint).

**Rationale:**
- The endpoint already does "understand this input and tell me what to search for"
- Adding URL detection is a small addition (~20 lines)
- Keeps one entry point for the frontend - less UI complexity
- If it grows too complex later, can extract to `/api/research/analyze-app`

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In /api/research/interpret-hypothesis/route.ts

const trimmedInput = rawInput.trim();

if (isAppStoreUrl(trimmedInput)) {
  // NEW: App-centric flow
  const appDetails = await getAppDetails(trimmedInput);
  const prompt = buildAppAnalysisPrompt(appDetails);
  // ... call Claude with app-specific prompt
  return { mode: 'app-analysis', appData, problemDomains, searchPhrases };
} else {
  // EXISTING: Hypothesis interpretation flow
  return { mode: 'hypothesis', interpretation, refinementSuggestions };
}
```

**Discriminated Union Response Type:**

```typescript
type InterpretResult =
  | { 
      mode: 'hypothesis'; 
      interpretation: HypothesisInterpretation;
      refinementSuggestions: Suggestion[];
    }
  | { 
      mode: 'app-analysis'; 
      appData: AppMetadata;
      problemDomains: string[];
      searchPhrases: string[];
      targetAudience: string;
    }
```

**URL Pattern Detection:**

```typescript
function isAppStoreUrl(input: string): boolean {
  return (
    input.includes('play.google.com/store/apps') ||
    input.includes('apps.apple.com/app')
  );
}

function extractAppId(url: string): { store: 'google_play' | 'app_store'; appId: string } | null {
  // play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calm.android → com.calm.android
  // apps.apple.com/app/calm/id571800810 → 571800810
  // ...
}
```

#### 3.8.3 App Metadata Extraction

**Decision:** Add `getAppDetails(urlOrAppId)` method to each adapter.

The `google-play-scraper` and `app-store-scraper` packages both support `app({ appId })` for full metadata.

**Interface:**

```typescript
interface AppDetails {
  appId: string;
  name: string;
  developer: string;
  category: string;
  description: string;      // Full description text
  rating: number;           // 1-5 stars
  reviewCount: number;
  price: string;            // "Free", "$4.99", etc.
  hasIAP: boolean;
  installs?: string;        // Google Play only: "10M+"
  lastUpdated: string;
  iconUrl?: string;
  url: string;
}
```

**Add to each adapter:**

```typescript
// google-play-adapter.ts
async getAppDetails(urlOrAppId: string): Promise<AppDetails | null> {
  const appId = extractAppIdFromUrl(urlOrAppId) || urlOrAppId;
  const details = await gplay.app({ appId });
  return {
    appId: details.appId,
    name: details.title,
    developer: details.developer,
    category: details.genre,
    description: details.description,
    rating: details.score,
    reviewCount: details.reviews,
    price: details.free ? 'Free' : details.priceText,
    hasIAP: details.offersIAP,
    installs: details.installs,
    lastUpdated: details.updated,
    iconUrl: details.icon,
    url: details.url,
  };
}

// app-store-adapter.ts  
async getAppDetails(urlOrAppId: string): Promise<AppDetails | null> {
  const appId = extractAppIdFromUrl(urlOrAppId) || urlOrAppId;
  const details = await store.app({ id: appId });
  return {
    appId: String(details.id),
    name: details.title,
    developer: details.developer,
    category: details.primaryGenre,
    description: details.description,
    rating: details.score,
    reviewCount: details.reviews,
    price: details.free ? 'Free' : details.price,
    hasIAP: details.hasIAP,
    lastUpdated: details.updated,
    iconUrl: details.icon,
    url: details.url,
  };
}
```

#### 3.8.4 AI Problem Interpretation

**Decision:** Same module (`interpret-hypothesis`), separate prompt branch for apps.

**Rationale:**
- Same conceptual task: "understand what this is about and tell me what to search"
- Reuses auth, error handling, response parsing
- Avoids module proliferation

**App-Specific Prompt:**

```
You are analyzing an app to understand what problem it solves and who it serves.

APP DETAILS:
- Name: {{name}}
- Category: {{category}}
- Description: {{description}}
- Rating: {{rating}} ({{reviewCount}} reviews)
- Price: {{price}}

SAMPLE REVIEWS (if available):
{{top3Positive}}
{{top3Negative}}

Extract:

1. PRIMARY PROBLEM DOMAIN
   What core problem does this app solve? (e.g., "stress and anxiety management through meditation")

2. SECONDARY PROBLEM DOMAINS  
   What related problems does it address? (e.g., "sleep improvement", "focus/productivity")

3. TARGET AUDIENCE CHARACTERISTICS
   Who uses this app? Be specific. (e.g., "Busy professionals and stressed adults seeking accessible mental health tools")

4. SEARCH PHRASES
   What phrases would people use when discussing this type of problem on Reddit/forums?
   - At least 5 problem-focused phrases
   - At least 3 "alternatives to [app]" style phrases

5. COMPETITOR TERMS
   What other apps/solutions might users compare this to?

Respond in JSON format.
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "primaryDomain": "meditation and mindfulness for stress reduction",
  "secondaryDomains": ["sleep improvement", "anxiety management", "focus and productivity"],
  "targetAudience": "Busy professionals and stressed adults seeking accessible mental wellness tools",
  "searchPhrases": [
    "can't sleep racing thoughts",
    "meditation app recommendations",
    "is calm worth the subscription",
    "alternatives to headspace",
    "free meditation apps"
  ],
  "competitorTerms": ["Headspace", "Insight Timer", "Ten Percent Happier"]
}
```

---

#### 3.8.5 Confirmation Step

**Decision:** Keep confirmation step, but streamlined.

**Rationale:**
- User pasted a URL, but they still need to see: "I'll search Reddit for 'meditation apps', 'sleep problems', 'alternatives to Calm'"
- They might want to adjust (e.g., focus on "sleep" not "meditation")
- Matches the existing UX pattern - consistency matters

**Streamlined Flow:**

**What's streamlined:**
- Auto-select the most relevant subreddits
- Pre-check HN if it's a productivity/tech app
- Skip the "do you want to refine?" step - go straight to coverage preview

---

#### 3.8.6 Multi-Geography Reviews

**Decision:** Smart default (primary market), opt-in expansion.

**Implementation:**

1. **Default:** Fetch from the app's primary market (detect from URL or app data)
2. **Show:** "Reviews from: US" with "Add more markets" button
3. **Expansion:** Clicking expands to US + UK + AU + CA (major English markets)

**Rationale:**
- Fastest default experience (1 API call, not 4)
- User control without upfront friction
- English markets only to keep relevance high (non-English reviews need translation)

**Code:**

```typescript
// Default behavior
const primaryMarket = detectMarketFromUrl(url) || 'us';
let reviews = await getReviews(appId, { country: primaryMarket });

// If user clicks "Add more markets"
const additionalMarkets = ['us', 'gb', 'au', 'ca'].filter(m => m !== primaryMarket);
const moreReviews = await Promise.all(
  additionalMarkets.map(market => getReviews(appId, { country: market }))
);
reviews = deduplicateAndMerge(reviews, ...moreReviews);
```

**Market Detection:**

```typescript
function detectMarketFromUrl(url: string): string {
  // apps.apple.com/gb/app/calm/id571800810 → 'gb'
  // apps.apple.com/us/app/calm/id571800810 → 'us'
  // play.google.com/store/apps/... (no region in URL) → 'us' default
  const match = url.match(/apps\.apple\.com\/([a-z]{2})\//i);
  return match?.[1]?.toLowerCase() || 'us';
}
```

---

#### 3.8.7 Output Format: New Tab Structure

**Decision:** New tab structure, reuse existing components where possible.

**Proposed Tabs:**

| Tab | Content | Component Strategy |
|-----|---------|--------------------|
| **App Overview** | Name, rating, downloads, price, description summary | New component |
| **User Feedback** | What users love + pain points + feature requests (from reviews) | Similar to existing pain signals UI |
| **Market Context** | Reddit/HN discussions about this app AND the problem domain | Existing community voice UI |
| **Opportunities** | Unmet needs, opportunity score, "if building a competitor..." | New component |

**Key insight:** The "Market Context" tab is basically existing Community Voice research, just auto-configured with AI-generated search terms instead of user-entered ones.

**Tab 1: App Overview**

#### 3.8.8 Credit Cost

**Decision:** Same cost (1 credit) initially, monitor and adjust.

**Rationale:**
- The extra work is marginal: 1 app metadata fetch + ~100 reviews
- The Reddit/HN search is the same cost as existing research
- Users expect "1 research = 1 credit"
- If it proves to be 2x the value, charge 2x LATER once proven

**Future consideration:** If multi-geo is enabled (4 markets), that's 4x the review API calls → could justify 2 credits. But start simple.

---

#### 3.8.9 Implementation Checklist

**Phase 1: URL Detection & App Metadata (Week 1)**
- [ ] Add `isAppStoreUrl()` detection to `interpret-hypothesis`

#### 3.8.10 Why This Matters for VCs

When a VC is evaluating a pitch from a meditation app startup, they want to know:
- Are users actually dissatisfied with Calm/Headspace? (app reviews) ✅
- Is the pain the startup claims to solve *real*? (Reddit/HN validation) ✅
- What are the specific gaps no one is filling? (cross-source synthesis) ✅
- Is this founder's insight genuine or are they solving a non-problem? ✅

**PVRE answers all of these with one app URL paste.**

This positions App-Centric Analysis as **due diligence automation** — a £500-2000/month value proposition because it replaces hours of manual research their analysts currently do.

---

## Phase 4: VC Features

### 4.1 VC Use Case

**Same engine, different packaging.**

**What VCs need:**
- Quick validation of pitch deck claims
- Competitive landscape the founder didn't mention
- Independent market demand verification
- Red flags to probe in founder calls

**PVRE answers:** "Is this founder's thesis correct?"
